### Hi there 👋

I am Ziyue, a master student at KU Leuven who have two cute cats🐱.      

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my courses and master thesis (on meta and Stata programming 💻).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a economic journal paper.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project concerning labour economics/applying machine learning.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Econ Phd applications.
- 💬 Ask me about anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: ziyue.zhu16@gmail.com

- ⚡ Fun fact: my cat typed these words.
